# Arduino_RFID_DOOR_LOCK
RFID Door Lock System Using Arduino

Welcome to the RFID Door Lock System project repository! This project demonstrates how to build a secure and efficient door locking system using an Arduino and an RFID module. With this system, you can control access using RFID cards, ensuring only authorized users can unlock the door.

📦 Project Overview

This RFID Door Lock System integrates an RFID reader with an Arduino microcontroller to create a smart access control mechanism. When an authorized RFID tag is scanned, the system unlocks the door, ensuring security. This project is ideal for home automation, office security, and educational purposes.

🛠 Components Required

Arduino Uno: The microcontroller used to process RFID data.

RFID Reader (MFRC522): Reads RFID tags to verify access.

RFID Tags/Cards: Used to authenticate users.

Solenoid Door Lock: Controls the locking mechanism.

Jumper Wires: For making connections.

Breadboard: For prototyping.

📂 Project Structure

/code: Contains the Arduino sketch (rfid_door_lock.ino) to operate the system.

/docs: Documentation files, including setup instructions and diagrams.

/images: Project images and circuit schematics.

⚙️ Installation and Setup

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RFID-Door-Lock-System.git
cd RFID-Door-Lock-System

Connect Components

Refer to the schematic diagram for wiring the RFID reader, servo motor, and other components to the Arduino board.

Upload the Code

Open rfid_door_lock.ino in the Arduino IDE.

Select the appropriate board and port.

Upload the sketch to your Arduino.

Power Up

Once connected to power, the system is ready to function.

📜 Code Explanation

RFID Reading: The system reads the RFID tag and checks it against a stored list of authorized users.

Access Control: If the tag is authorized, the door unlocks; otherwise, an alert is triggered.
